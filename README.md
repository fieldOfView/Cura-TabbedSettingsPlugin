# Cura Tabbed Settings Plugin

This plugin adds tabs for categories to the custom print settings.
The plugin is currently in an experimental stage.

## Cura version compatibility

When a new release of Cura is available, the Tabbed Settings plugin always needs to be updated.

In order for the Tabbed Settings plugin to work, it does quite a bit of "nasty" patching of the original interface. These patches may break the interface when the original interface is changed. So, as a security measure, the plugin checks to see if it has been "approved" for the version of Cura you are using it with.

An updated version of the plugin is usually created during the beta period, so when a new stable release of Cura is available, the plugin update is available in the Marketplace. Because updates to plugins need to be checked and approved by Ultimaker developers, there is always a bit of a delay.
